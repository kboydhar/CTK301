<p class="pixelwidth">I normally just put random lyrics in for text. "There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained. There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car. And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, Yeah
We're drivin' down the road. I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless"</p>

<p class="percentwidth">This is a paragraph with percent width.
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless. And I don't know why but with you I'd dance. In a storm in my best dress
Fearless. Well you stood there with me in the doorway my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but. You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.</p>
