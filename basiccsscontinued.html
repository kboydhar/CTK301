<p> I needed random text for the example so
<p> These are random song lyrics from Kim Kibum, a member of the Korean boy group Shinee. </p>
<p> The song is called Easy to Love from his solo album, Face.</p>

<p class=textright> "I want to be alone In the early morning, the TV is on again Inside the meaningless <br>
  (Oh) Loud noises, I bury myself An image of me that’s just like my usual self Is shown on the screen suddenly <br>
  If I excitedly open my heart that’s wrapped up like a present I find out that it’s as light as an empty box Even <br>
  if I say I want to meet someone I like being alone because it’s so easy I also don’t understand my heart"</p>

<p class=textleft> "Cause I’m not easy to love So stranger-ous I end up seeing the prickly me It seems <br>
  I’ll forever be in my arms. I’m not easy to love So dangerous Even if I try to fix my <br>
  heart I’m hesitating for some reason oh Although <br>
  it’s an unexpectedly Very busy day You know what it’s <br>
  like No one’s inspired Inside this boring life
  I want to find something that’ll wake me up whoa" </p>

  <p class= textcenter> "It’d be nice if there was anyone Even if
  I set off thinking I’m lonely The road that I have to go round and <br>
  round on stretches far I pluck off the petals of a flower and entrust my fate to it <br>
  If you entrust all of yourself to the frivolous me I’m sorry, <br>
  I can’t hold you any longer Cause I’m not easy to love So stranger-ous I
  end up seeing the prickly me It seems I’ll forever be in my arms<br>
  I’m not easy to love So dangerous Even if I try to fix my heart <br>
  I’m hesitating for some reason oh H.A.R.D. To L.O.V.E <br>
  Everything isn’t easy H.A.R.D. To L.O.V.E" </p>

  <p class= textjustify> "Hey! I’m not easy to love Everything’s messed up, <br>
  everything’s just difficult My head is full of chaos Cause I’m not easy to love, <br>
  it worries me I’m not the only one like this, right? I don’t know the answer" </p>

  <p class= textspace>"Cause I’m not easy to love </p>

  <p class= textheight> "H.A.R.D. To L.O.V.E I’m sleepless from worry again <br>
  Cause I’m not easy to love H.A.R.D. To L.O.V.E I’m hesitating for some reason <br>
  oh Cause I’m not easy to love" </p>
